Compilation
-----------

All the C++ dependencies required to build the code are included. It should work on Windows, macOS and Linux, and it should build out of the box with CMake:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j4

On Linux `zenity` is required for the file dialog window to work. On macOS and Windows the native windows are used directly.
The formula for higher order bases are computed at CMake time using an external python script. Consequently, PolyFEM requires a working installation of Python and some additional packages in order to build correctly:

- `numpy` and `sympy`
- `quadpy` (optional)

Usage
-----

The main executable, `./PolyFEM_bin`, can be called with a GUI or through a command-line interface. Simply run: 

    ./PolyFEM_bin

Documentation
-------------

- [Quickstart tutorial](tutorial.md) (coming soon).
- [Reference documentation](documentation.md) for the json configuration and problem types.
